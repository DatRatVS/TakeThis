# Why would I even drop an item now?!

- Usage:
**Shift + Right Click** looking at another player with your item in your hands, to get this item transferred for them!

- Additional info:
 You may configure the plugin as you wish in the `TakeThis/config.json5` file.
 You may not mess with the `TakeThis/config.yml` file, because it is used to store opt-in and out variables.
 
- Known issues:
 Sometimes the variable ${item_quantity} will show wrong values in the chat, but items can be transferred correctly (i hope so).
