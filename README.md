## Why would I even drop an item now?!<br>
**An highly configurable option to pass your items between sneaking players!**

**Additional info:**

- You may configure the plugin as you wish in the TakeThis/config.json5 file.
- You may not mess with the TakeThis/config.yml file, because it is used to store opt-in and out variables.

**Known issues:**

- Sometimes the variable ${item_quantity} will show wrong values in the chat, but items can be transferred correctly (i hope so).

**Commands:**

- **/takethis reload** requires the takethis.reload permission.<br>
Reloads all the variables set into the TakeThis/config.json5 file.

- **/takethis opt**<br>
Opts in or out from the plugin, making it impossible to receive or give items.
